For web3 use ethereum with sepolia test net as priority 1
always try to use wagmi hooks instead of raw ether or veim query to interact with contract
Always refer the latest docs based on the version of the packages installed 
Use veim for interacting with contract if wagmi hook isn't applicable for that case
